# generate_SBDART_input_atms
Using python code to generate input file and atms.dat file for SBDART

These codes are just crude prototype of my research in atmospheric science,
some of them are even manuscripts, some of them can solve few questions about
SBDART model input file.

                          ~~~///(^v^)\\\~~~
I'm a graduate student in school of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University,
currntly working on SBDART model trying to compute LW, SW flux of the whole globe.
I'm just a rookie in python coding, there will probably be plenty of errors during
using of my code, feel free to use any of my code and please contact me if you
cant understand my code or meet some weird problems.

Hope my pathetic code can inspire some of you.I will continue updating this repository!
