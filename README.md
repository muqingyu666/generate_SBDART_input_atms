# Python Code for Generating Input and Atms.dat Files for SBDART

The following is a brief description of the Python code for generating input and atms.dat files for the SBDART radiative transfer model:

- The code is written in Python and is designed to generate the input and atms.dat files required by the SBDART radiative transfer model.
- The code is intended to be used in atmospheric science research and may be used to solve specific questions related to SBDART model input file generation. 
- The code is still in development and may be subject to frequent updates and changes. 
- The code is intended as a prototype and may not be suitable for production use without additional testing and validation. 
- The code includes comments and documentation to help users understand its functionality and usage.

Technical notes:

- The code is intended for advanced users and requires a strong understanding of atmospheric science and radiative transfer models. 
- The code may require additional libraries or dependencies to run, such as NumPy or Pandas. 
- The code may require additional inputs or parameters to accurately model different atmospheric conditions or configurations. 
- The code should be thoroughly tested and validated before being used in any critical applications, and any errors or bugs should be addressed before deployment.
- The code may be modified or extended to support additional features or use cases, but should be carefully tested and validated before being used in production.
